Codepath Week 5 homework

Time spent: 5 hours so far... spent more time thinking about the group project and this works pretty bad... Will be working on updates to this during the day today.

##Requirements
- Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
- Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
- On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
- If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
